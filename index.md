### CPSC 120

*Lab 1

Lab 1 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was my first time ever coding something. I was very nervous because I had no prior experience but I was able to use what I had learned in class to finish this lab. The simplicity of printing your name at the time was very nerve racking and honestly was not that easy. The feeling of that first successful string was when I knew this major was for me. The adrenaline rush I received when it successfully printed my name is a feeling like no other. My first ever working code was in that lab and it was an amazing experience.

*Lab 4

Lab 4 part 2 was a very fun experience. It was the high low game that everyone had played before. It was interesting how in english I knew how to play the game but putting it into code was a completely different story. After a long time outside of class me and my partner were able to finish. Using the if statements was a lot of fun and helped me understand them to another level. I really enjoyed the feeling of playing a game or making a game with my code. It was difficult but in the end very rewarding and it made me realize how much we are capable of doing with the stuff we are learning.

*Lab 6

Lab 6 part 2 was such an awesome lab idea. The blackjack idea was so cool and it was a game that I knew how to play. It was such a difficult game and concept to learn so I knew the lab would be difficult. Using the booleans, if statements, and integers was a really good way to make us use our brains. I really loved how it included the special ace rule like real blackjack and how we had to make the working version. It worked really well and I enjoyed the process of making it due to the complexity and how it felt like the real game in the end.
